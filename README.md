# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

This repository contains: a file containing project code and a file containing a brief write up explaining your solution.The code file is called P1.ipynb and the writeup template is writeup_template.md 

---
The writeup consists of three parts:

1. Description of the pipeline

2. Identification of any shortcomings

3. Suggestions, possible improvements


The Project
---
The project code is in a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter is an Ipython notebook where you can run blocks of code and see results interactively.  All the code for this project is contained in a Jupyter notebook. To start Jupyter in your browser, use terminal to navigate to your project directory and then run the following command at the terminal prompt.
